Is there a quick way I can export my AWS EC2, VPC, Lambda, IAM (security groups) configurations, Dynamo and RDS configurations?

Yes, you can use AWS CloudFormation to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources by provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable way. You can create a CloudFormation template that describes your desired configurations for the resources, and AWS CloudFormation will take care of creating and configuring them for you.

To quickly export your existing AWS configurations, you can follow these steps:

    Install the AWS CLI if you haven't already: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

    Use AWS CLI to generate CloudFormation templates for your existing resources. The following commands will help you get started:

For EC2:

css

aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[]' > ec2.json

For VPC:

css

aws ec2 describe-vpcs --query 'Vpcs[]' > vpcs.json

For Lambda:

python

aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[]' > lambda.json

For IAM (security groups):

sql

aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[]' > security-groups.json

For DynamoDB:

css

aws dynamodb list-tables --query 'TableNames[]' > dynamo-tables.txt

Then, for each table listed in dynamo-tables.txt:

sql

aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name TABLE_NAME > TABLE_NAME.json

For RDS:

css

aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[]' > rds.json

    Once you have exported the JSON files, you can use tools like Former2 (https://github.com/iann0036/former2) or AWS CloudFormer (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/cloudformer/) to generate CloudFormation templates from the exported data.

    You can then use the generated CloudFormation templates to recreate your infrastructure as needed.

Keep in mind that these commands and tools might not capture every single detail of your infrastructure, and you may need to manually tweak the templates to suit your needs.
